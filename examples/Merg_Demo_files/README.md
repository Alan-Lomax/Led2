# MERG Demo Files

   These are the files used during the presentation to MERG Arduino SIG on January 25 2022.
   Published so that interested parties can review them as examples.
   
   No claim is made that they are particularly good or even useful.
   
   To run these samples put Led2.h and Led2.cpp in the same folder as the sketch
   (or put Led2.h and Led2.cpp in your libraries folder once)
   This was explained during the video talk.
